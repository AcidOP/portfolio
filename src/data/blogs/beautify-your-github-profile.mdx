# Add a README.md

What is the _first_ thing people see when they come to your Github profile?

Your **Bio** section.

So how can we make a good bio that stands out?

First things first, we create the needed repository.

Head to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a repo with your username as the repo name.  
For example if your username is **AcidOP** then you must name the repo as `AcidOP`.

![Create Repo](/blogs/beautify-your-github-profile/create-repo.png)

If all has been well you should see the following in your screen:

![Special Repo](/blogs/beautify-your-github-profile/special.png)

Now in the repo create a file called `README.md`. \
Anything you put in this file will be displayed in your github profile.

# Use your creativity

This is your place to shine âœ¨

Learn some [markdown](/blogs/markdown-cheatsheet) and put it to good use.

### Add a beautiful header ðŸ‘‡

2. Customize the banner to your liking.
3. Download the banner and upload it to github.
4. Add the line in the beginning of your `readme.md`:\
   `![Header](./your-header-image-name.png)`

### Add icons in your Github Bio ðŸ‘‡

Who doesn't love colorful visuals?

[Skill Icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#specifying-icons) is an amazing source of free icons.

Just add the following line:\
`![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,wasm)`

Change the `?i=js,html,css` to a list of your skills separated by `,`.\
Find the full [list of icons here](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#icons-list).

### Add statistics in your Github bio ðŸ‘‡

Paste the following in your Readme:
\
\
Replace `<USERNAME>` with **your** github username

1. Overall Stats:
   \
   \
   `![](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=<USERNAME>)`
   \
   \
   Here you can also [customize the theme with the API](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats?tab=readme-ov-file#all-inbuilt-themes).

2. Total Contributions and streaks:
   \

**My 2 cents:**

- Keep all text short and to the point
- Use relevant images or gifs to make it more engaging
- Add links to your best projects and social media profiles
- **DONT** make it way too flashy

# Contribute to projects

How can you build a **strong presence** on GitHub?

Contribution is key to showing you are an _active and passionate_ member of the developer community.

You will add to the community as well as increase your network with other developers.

![Contribution Graph](/blogs/beautify-your-github-profile/contribution.png)

Here are **4 ways** you can contribute:

- Find repositories that need help
- Add more to the libraries you already use
- Create your own open source project
- Report bugs and suggest improvements

**NOTE**: \
\
Spam is a common technique for some developers to contribute, but it's best to stay away from it as it can harm your reputation and cause the project maintainer needless trouble.

# Good GitHub Bio Section

The GitHub bio section is a brief introduction about yourself that appears at the top of your profile.

It is important to keep it simple yet engaging.

Here are **3 tips** to write a good bio:

- Use keywords that describe your skills and expertise
- Mention your current job title or what you are studying
- Add a touch of humor to make it more interesting
