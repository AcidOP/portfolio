## Project Overview

This is my own portfolio, that I made in a course of 6 _slow_ months with a passion.

Every component is built tastefully with optimization being a priority.

The design is a hybrid of neubrutalism and the new minimal trend.

I intentionally left a lot of white spaces all around to make it look neat while also keeping some blobs of color to add depth.

I use this to [write blogs](/blogs) as well as show [my creativity and works](/works).
